# CS3500 Assignment07
## By Anthony and Christine

We implemented the image mosaicking through creating an Image function object.
ImageFunctionObject is an already provided interface used for creating other Image
altering functions. We then implemented the function object in ImageControllerImpl,
and ImageGuiControllerImpl in the same fashion all the other function objects were 
written. For the Gui, we had to implement a new button in their already made panels 
for mosaicking.

Image mosaicking implementation: Y
Script command to mosaic an image: Y
